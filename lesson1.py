# Create a list of strings: fellowship
fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'aragorn', 'legolas', 'boromir', 'gimli']

# Create dict comprehension: new_fellowship
new_fellowship = {member: len(member) for member in fellowship}

# Print the new dictionary
print(new_fellowship)


# Comprehentions - store list in memory
#Generators - return it when needed. Gen Object does not include the entire list.
# Use yield instead of print or return

# Create generator object: result
result = (num for num in range(31))

# Print the first 5 values
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))
print(next(result))

# Print the rest of the values
for value in result:
    print(value)
